# Lithofacies-Prediction
A Machine Learning Model to predict the Lithofacies of a well based on Open Hole Log Reading
# Inspiration Behind This Project
Just the other day, I stumbled upon a repositories from mardani72 (check out his github) and I thought this could help the petrophysics in petroleum industries a lot. So I tweaked the project a little and only include ensamble/gradient boosting models and omit a few features that never used in my company. The result is pretty decent about 81% accuracy.
